        <h1>Why Endangered Species Matter</h1>
        <p>A study in 2015 found that the extinction rate has increased a hundredfold over the last century—mainly due to human causes.</p>
        <p>But the questions remain: So what? Why does it matter?</p>
        <p class="emphasis">The short answer is: to preserve the ecosystem.</p>
        <p>The food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we drink all depend on a delicate ecosystem. Even seemingly menial species like photosynthetic plankton in the sea have a huge impact on our quality of life.</p>
        <p>It also has a drastic affect on our economy. A study in 2010 found that “unchecked species loss would wipe 18% off global economic output by 2050.”</p>
        <p>When one network of species dies, it affects dozens of other species, which often includes the human species. And many of the effects are unknowable until it’s too late to reverse them.</p>
        <p>In order to ensure the longevity of the planet, the human species, and the species of all living animals, it is important that we protect an ecosystem that is as rich and diverse as possible.</p>
