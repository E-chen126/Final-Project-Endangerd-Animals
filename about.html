              <p>Asian elephants have been considered an endangered species since 1986, as their population has decreased by at least 50% over the last 75 years or so. There are fewer than 50,000 remaining in the wild.</p>
              <p>Fragmentation, deforestation and an increasing human population are destroying the elephants' habitat and decreasing the space available for them to live in.</p>
              <p>The Sri Lankan, Indian and Sumatran Asian elephants can of course be found in their countries of name and other mainland Asian countries.</p>
              <p>However, the best opportunity to see Asian elephants is at The Gathering, a natural assembly of up to 300 elephants coming to the shores of the Minneriya Tank in Sri Lanka's Minneriya National Park during August to bathe and drink. It is the largest congregation of Asian elephants in the world.</p>

            <div class="text">
              <p>At the beginning of the 20th century, there were 100,000 tigers in the world. Today, this number is estimated to have dwindled to <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/tiger" target="_blank">round 3,900 in the wild</a>.</p>
              <p>Tigers need large areas of habitat, but living in some of the most densely populated places on Earth has placed them in locations that have caused significant conflict with humans. Habitat destruction and fragmentation has had the most significant effects on the tigers' habitats, and poaching is one of their biggest threats.</p>
              <p>India is the best country to see tigers in the wild, but you can also spot tigers in Bangladesh, China, Sumatra, Siberia and Nepal. </p>

            <div class="text">
              <p>Once the most widespread of Asian rhinos, Javan rhinos are now listed as critically endangered. With only one known population in the wild, it is one of the world's rarest large mammals.</p>
              <p>There are between <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/javan-rhino" target="_blank">58 and 68 in the wild</a>, with none living in captivity. The rhinos are often poached for their horns, although loss of habitat, especially resulting from the Vietnam War, has also contributed to their decline.</p>
              <p>The only population of Javan rhinos can be found in <a href="https://www.indonesia.travel/uk/en/destinations/java/ujung-kulon-national-park"  target="_blank">Ujung Kulon National Park</a> on the south-western tip of Java, Indonesia. The only other population, in Vietnam, was wiped out in 2010.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="text">
              <p>In between 26,000 and 43,000 female sea turtles nest annually; a dramatic decline from the estimated 115,000 in 1980. Young turtles are incredibly vulnerable and sadly, very few make it to adulthood.</p>
              <p>Birds and small mammals often dig up turtle nests in order to eat the eggs. Once they've hatched, birds and crustaceans pick them off before they can make it to the sea, and fish, squid and octopuses often prey on them if they do manage to make it into the water.</p>
              <p>The prime nesting spots for the turtles are in Suriname, French Guiana, Grand Anse beach in Saint Lucia, Turtle Beach in Tobago, Guyana's Shell Beach and Gabon.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.mayumbanationalpark.com/"  target="_blank">Mayumba National Park</a> beaches in Gabon host the largest nesting population on the African continent. April is the time to visit, when around 30,000 turtles descend on the park's beaches to lay their eggs.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="text">
              <p>Today, around 1,063 mountain gorillas are thought to exist in the wild, and the future is looking brighter for these rare primates.</p>
              <p>Since 1981, the gorilla population has almost doubled. 30 years ago, experts feared they were soon to be extinct. Thanks to intensive conservation efforts, mountain gorillas were moved from 'critically endangered' to 'endangered' on the <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/39999/17989719"  target="_blank">IUCN red list </a>in 2018.</p>
              <p>However, illegal poaching, pollution, habitat deforestation, fragmentation and diseases caught from humans are still threatening their populations. They are often poached for their meat, and younger gorillas can be caught in snares meant for other animals. War and civil unrest have also impacted negatively on the gorillas.</p>
              <p>There are two mountain gorilla populations for travellers to visit. One group can be found in the Virunga volcanic mountains of Central Africa across three national parks: Uganda's Mgahinga National Park, Rwanda's <a href="https://www.volcanoesnationalparkrwanda.com/"  target="_blank">Volcanoes National Park</a>and DR Congo's <a href="https://virunga.org/"  target="_blank">Virunga National Park</a> (although this has been closed to tourists due to a recent violent rebellion).</p>
              <p>The other population inhabits Uganda's <a href="https://www.bwindiforestnationalpark.com/">Bwindi Impenetrable National Park</a>. You're most likely to see mountain gorillas in Rwanda or Uganda, and you're unlikely to return disappointed.</p>
